First Assignment Attolino Nicholas
	What does the code do?
	There are 5 functions: drive, turn, find_silver, find_golden, checklist and each function is explained below;
	furthermore, 'while cycle' represents the steps that the robot must take to achieve the goal:
	to pair each SILVER token with each GOLDEN token.
	1) The first step represents the robot that initially look the closest SILVER token and tries to take it;
	2) Once taked, the program stores the offset of the SILVER token into the List 'tokens_taked' so that it no longer
	has to be considered among all the available SILVER tokens;
	2) After that, the robot look the closest GOLDEN token and release the SILVER token near to the GOLDEN token;
	3) At this point, the program stores the offset of the GOLDEN token into the List 'tokens_taked' so that it no longer
	has to be considered among all the available GOLDEN tokens;
	4) Now, the List has the first Pair and the program will continue to repeat each step until the last GOLDEN token
	because after the last, the program will warn us with a message that tells 'List Full, impossible to continue!'
